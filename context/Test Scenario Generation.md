Generate comprehensive test scenarios for [feature/component]. Include:
1. Happy path scenarios (normal operation)
2. Edge cases (boundary values, empty states)
3. Error conditions (system failures, invalid inputs)
4. Performance considerations (load testing scenarios)
5. Security scenarios (unauthorized access attempts)

For each scenario, specify the test type (unit, integration, system), preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes. Focus especially on non-obvious edge cases that might be overlooked.
