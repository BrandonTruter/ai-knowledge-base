I want to master [Rails topic]. Create a knowledge tree that maps out what I need to learn, structured from foundational to advanced concepts. For each concept:
1. Provide a concise definition
2. Explain why it's important
3. List prerequisites
4. Suggest a practical exercise to apply it
5. Link it to related concepts

Format as a hierarchical outline with clear progression paths. Highlight concepts that are particularly important for production applications.
