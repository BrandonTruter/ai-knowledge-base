I'm debugging a Rails application issue. Below I'll share the error message, relevant code snippets, and what I've tried so far. Approach this problem systematically by:
1. Analyzing the error message to identify the root cause
2. Examining my code for logical errors or Rails misconceptions
3. Suggesting 2-3 specific debugging techniques I should try next
4. Providing a hypothesis about the most likely cause
5. Recommending a solution with explanation of why it should work

Do not suggest generic debugging steps like "check logs" unless you explain exactly what to look for.
