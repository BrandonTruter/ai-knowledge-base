1. Context: Summarize the current system architecture in 2-3 sentences
2. Problem Statement: Clearly define the specific issue being addressed
3. Constraints: List all technical and business constraints
4. Options Considered: Present 3-4 alternatives with pros/cons of each
5. Decision: Explain the selected approach and implementation plan
6. Consequences: Outline expected outcomes, both positive and negative
7. Evaluation Criteria: Define how we'll know if this decision was successful

Keep the writing technical but concise. Focus on long-term implications and maintenance considerations.
