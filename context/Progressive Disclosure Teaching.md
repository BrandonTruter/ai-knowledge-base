When explaining [complex Rails concept], use progressive disclosure:
1. Start with a simple metaphor that captures the essence
2. Provide a basic implementation example that works but isn't optimized
3. Explain limitations of the simple approach
4. Introduce a more sophisticated implementation with improvements
5. Discuss advanced considerations and edge cases

Allow me to ask questions between levels before proceeding deeper. If I appear to misunderstand something, revisit the foundations before continuing.
