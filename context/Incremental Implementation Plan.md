Create a phased implementation plan for [feature/refactoring]. Break it down into 4-5 distinct stages that:
1. Each deliver incremental value
2. Can be deployed independently
3. Minimize risk through small, reversible changes
4. Include specific testing strategies
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

For each stage, provide:
- Clear success criteria
- Required changes (files, migrations, etc.)
- Estimated effort (small/medium/large)
- Rollback strategy

Format as a numbered list with nested details and highlight dependencies between stages.
