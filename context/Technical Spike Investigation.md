I need to conduct a technical spike on [technology/approach]. Create a structured investigation plan that includes:
1. Key questions that need answering (5-8 specific technical questions)
2. Required experiments with expected outcomes
3. Evaluation criteria for success
4. Time boxing suggestions for each investigation area
5. Potential risks and mitigation strategies
6. Documentation requirements

Focus on proving/disproving technical feasibility rather than full implementation.
