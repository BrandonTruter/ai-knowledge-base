For this conversation, maintain continuity by:
1. Referring back to previous code examples we've discussed
2. Building upon patterns established earlier in our conversation
3. Using consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes
4. Highlighting when new suggestions modify previous recommendations
5. Tracking design decisions we've already made

If you need more context about something we've previously discussed, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
