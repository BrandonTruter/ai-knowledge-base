## Guidelines

PRs should follow the guidelines and conventions of [the contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and broader nCino PDE standards. 

PRs must include one or more semantic commits used to produce new versions (when applicable) and
populate the changelog. Not every commit included must be a semantic commit.

Please include only legible semantic commit messages that are appropriate for the changelog.

Always use the correct prefix for the type of change, ex. feat, fix, chore, etc.
